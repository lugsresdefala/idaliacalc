// Since we don't have @tanstack/react-query as a direct dependency
// in this project and it's not being actively used, we'll create a simpler version

// Basic implementation that satisfies the TypeScript interface but isn't functional
// You can replace this with the actual react-query implementation if needed

export class QueryClient {
  constructor() {
    // Simple placeholder for constructor
  }
  
  // Add any required methods here if they are used elsewhere in the code
  // Otherwise this empty class will satisfy TypeScript
}
